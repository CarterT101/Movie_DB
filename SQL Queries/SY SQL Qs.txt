Here are some SQL questions you can practice with using the given table schema:
Basic Selection and Filtering:
	1	Retrieve the Artist, Track, and Energy for all tracks with Energy above 0.8.
	2	Find the Album title, Artist, and Track for all albums of type "single".
	3	List the Url_Spotify, Track, and Danceability for the 5 tracks with the highest Danceability.
	4	Display the Artist, Album, and total number of tracks for each album.
	5	Show the Artist, Track, and Duration_ms for the longest track.
Combining Data:
	6	Join the Spotify and YouTube data to display Artist, Track, Url_Spotify, and Views for each track. Handle cases where there might not be corresponding YouTube data.
	7	Combine the Spotify and YouTube data to calculate the average Views per track for each Artist.
Aggregation and Grouping:
	8	Find the average Danceability, Energy, and Valence for each Artist.
	9	Calculate the total number of tracks, total Views, and average Likes for each Channel.
	10	Group the tracks by Album_type and count the number of tracks in each group.
Conditional Logic and Subqueries:
	11	Retrieve the Artist, Track, and Album for all tracks that are both licensed and have an official video.
	12	Find the Artist and Track for the track with the highest Likes-to-Views ratio.
	13	List the Artist, Track, and Danceability for tracks that have a higher Danceability than the average Danceability across all tracks.
Text-Based Queries:
	14	Search for tracks whose titles contain the word "love".
	15	Filter tracks based on descriptions that mention specific genres (e.g., "rock", "pop").
Additional Challenges:
	16	Identify tracks that have similar audio characteristics based on features like Danceability, Energy, and Tempo.
	17	Explore relationships between audio features and YouTube metrics (Views, Likes, Comments).
	18	Create meaningful visualizations to represent the data and insights gained from your queries.
